# project restructuring notes!

- Replace all calls to `codeSnippet` with `codeSnippet_1`. THis'll make the calls way cleaner and easier to understand, as the differentiation between `codeSnippet` and `codeSnippet_1` seems extremely arbitrary.

- In our data.js file, separate our ThemeToggle code snippets better.
